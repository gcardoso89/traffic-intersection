# Traffic Intersection
This is a possible implementation of a Traffic Intersection, composed by two streets, each with one Traffic Light.


## What has been used?
- **Webpack** - to transpile the ES2016 and ES2017 code into ES2015
- **Node-compass** - Use SCSS with compass as CSS preprocessor
-- All the SCSS files were moved into the project's root, to only use the CSS generated file on the public website
- **Express** - Why not?
- **Mocha & Chai** - For the the logic part unit testing. The views don't have test coverage.
